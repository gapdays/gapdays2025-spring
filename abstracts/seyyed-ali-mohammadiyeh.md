#### Key Topics:

- **Definition:** An `n × n` grid where each symbol appears once per row and column.
- **Applications:** Used in statistics, cryptography, game design (e.g., Sudoku), and combinatorics.
- **Connection to Group Theory:** Latin squares are related to quasigroups, which satisfy similar uniqueness properties.

#### Historical Insights:

- **Leonhard Euler:** Developed foundational work; coined the term using Latin symbols.
- **Choi Seok-jeong:** Discovered orthogonal Latin squares before Euler, and constructed a magic square using them.

#### Terminology:

- **Order:** Size of the square (e.g., 3×3).
- **Growth:** Number of Latin squares increases rapidly with size (e.g., 12 for n=3, billions for n=6).
- **Sudoku:** Described as a Latin square with added regional constraints.
