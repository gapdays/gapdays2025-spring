### Latin Squares Meet Group Theory: Tools and Insights in GAP - LatinSquare GAP Package

> Department of Pure Mathematics, Faculty of Mathematical Sciences, University of Kashan, Kashan 87317-53153, I. R. Iran

This talk introduces Latin squares—structured square arrays with unique symbols per row and column—and explores their mathematical significance and applications.

#### Key Topics:

**Definition:** An `n × n` grid where each symbol appears once per row and column.

**Applications:** Used in statistics, cryptography, game design (e.g., Sudoku), and combinatorics.

**Connection to Group Theory:** Latin squares are related to quasigroups, which satisfy similar uniqueness properties.

#### Historical Insights:

**Leonhard Euler:** Developed foundational work; coined the term using Latin symbols.

**Choi Seok-jeong:** Discovered orthogonal Latin squares before Euler, and constructed a magic square using them.

#### Terminology:

**Order:** Size of the square (e.g., 3×3).

**Growth:** Number of Latin squares increases rapidly with size (e.g., 12 for n=3, billions for n=6).

**Sudoku:** Described as a Latin square with added regional constraints.
