The closest international airport is Brussels Airport. From there, there are several trains directly to one of the Brussels' stations. One of the train stations 
in the Brussels' region is Etterbeek, which is located almost next to the main campus of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. During week days, there are two direct trains
per hour from Brussels Airport to Etterbeek (IC to Namur/Dinant and S19 to Brussel-Schuman/Charleroi Central). During the weekend, there is only the S19 service (now
heading to Nijvel/Nivelles). However, there are 4-6 trains per hour from Brussels Airport to the train station Brussel Noord, where you can change on a train to Etterbeek.
